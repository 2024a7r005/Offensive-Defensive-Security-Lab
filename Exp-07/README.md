# Using OSINT Tools for Reconnaissance

## Overview
This experiment focuses on passive footprinting using Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) tools. Google Dorks and Shodan are used to gather publicly available information about a target without directly interacting with its systems.

## Aim
To perform passive reconnaissance using OSINT tools like Google Dorks and Shodan to collect publicly available target information.

## Objectives
- Understand the fundamentals of OSINT.
- Perform passive footprinting using search techniques.
- Identify publicly indexed information using Google Dorks.
- Explore exposed devices and services using Shodan.
- Understand potential information exposure risks.

## Tools Used

### 1. Google Dorks
Google Dorks uses advanced search operators to find specific information indexed by Google.

Examples:
- `site:example.com` – Finds pages from a particular domain.
- `site:example.com filetype:pdf` – Finds indexed PDF files.
- `site:example.com inurl:login` – Finds indexed URLs containing the word login.

### 2. Shodan
Shodan is a search engine for internet-connected devices. It helps identify publicly visible services and associated technical information.

Information explored:
- IP addresses
- Open ports
- Detected services
- Server details
- Available banners

## Procedure / Methodology
1. Selected an authorized target for reconnaissance.
2. Opened Google and performed searches using advanced operators.
3. Observed publicly indexed information related to the target.
4. Opened the Shodan website: https://www.shodan.io/
5. Searched for the authorized target's domain or IP address.
6. Examined publicly available information, including open ports and detected services.
7. Recorded the observations and identified possible information exposure risks.

## Observations

| Tool | Information Gathered |
|---|---|
| Google Dorks | Indexed pages, documents and URLs |
| Shodan | IP addresses, open ports and detected services |

## Key Learnings
- Understood the concept of Open-Source Intelligence.
- Learned how Google search operators help in information discovery.
- Explored Shodan for identifying internet-facing services.
- Understood the role of passive reconnaissance in cybersecurity.
- Learned how publicly exposed information can create security risks.

## Result
Successfully explored passive footprinting techniques using Google Dorks and Shodan to gather publicly available information and understand potential security exposures.

## Security Disclaimer
This experiment is performed strictly for educational purposes. Reconnaissance should only be conducted on systems for which permission has been granted. Do not attempt unauthorized access or intrusive scanning.
